# 4H-Bias-Zones-Normal-Distribution-with-Breakout-Zones
A volatility-based indicator that uses normal distribution on 4-hour returns to define dynamic bias zones. It plots upper and lower ±1σ zones around the 4H open price to highlight probable price bias areas, coloring the background when price breaks beyond these zones to signal potential breakout or reversal points.
