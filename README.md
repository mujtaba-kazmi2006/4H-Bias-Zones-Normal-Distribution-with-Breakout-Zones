Overview:

This indicator applies statistical analysis using normal distribution concepts on 4-hour (4H) price returns to dynamically define bias zones on the chart. It helps traders identify probable areas of price support and resistance based on historical volatility and price behavior.

By calculating the rolling mean and standard deviation of 4H returns over a user-defined lookback period, the indicator plots two key levels above and below the 4H open price. These represent ±1 standard deviation (σ) zones adjusted by a multiplier, visually defining a “bias corridor” where price tends to stay under normal conditions.

The indicator also provides visual cues for potential breakouts or reversals by coloring the background when the price closes above the upper bias zone or below the lower bias zone, suggesting a shift in market sentiment or increased momentum.

Features
Dynamic Bias Zones: Plots upper and lower bias zones based on rolling mean and standard deviation of 4H returns, offering a statistically grounded view of price bias.

Customizable Parameters:

Lookback Period: Number of 4H candles used for calculating rolling mean and standard deviation (default 50).

Standard Deviation Multiplier: Adjusts the width of the bias zones to fit different volatility regimes.

4H Open Price Reference: Uses the 4H open as the baseline price level, anchoring bias zones to a key intraday price.

Visual Breakout Signals: Background color shifts green when price breaks above the upper zone, and red when price drops below the lower zone, highlighting potential breakout or reversal conditions.

Overlay Mode: Indicator plots directly on the price chart for easy visual correlation with price action.

Calculates the return between the current and previous 4H candle close prices:

Rolling Statistics:
Computes the rolling simple moving average (mean) and standard deviation of the 4H returns over the specified lookback period.

Breakout Visualization:
Colors the background green when the price closes above the upper bias zone and red when it closes below the lower bias zone.

How to Use
Use this indicator to identify key bias zones where price is statistically likely to remain under normal market conditions.

Watch for price breaks beyond the upper or lower bias zones as potential signals for breakout momentum or reversal.

Combine with other technical analysis tools (volume, support/resistance, candlestick patterns) for more robust trade setups.

Adjust the lookback period and multiplier to fine-tune sensitivity to different instruments and timeframes.
